# Notes on FastSurfer

## What do I see in the repo?

- I see a huge repo with probably a bunch of stuff we don't need.
- We probably need to use the FastSurferVINN or the features within model with, since it outputs some segmentation and statistics of 95 classes, the which we'd likely need.
  - The notes on using this model states that the T1w neds to be up to 0.7mm resolution, above this and it's experimental.
