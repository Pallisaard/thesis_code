# Data collection notes

- We need to transform the images to (1 mm, 1 mm, 1 mm) using a matlab nni_xtool script
- We need to be careful since we grab so many data examples from different datasets. Particularly, some have different orientations and we need to have them all face the same direction.
- ds002898 didn't have an s3-bucket configured (wtf then fuck off with having it hosted???)
